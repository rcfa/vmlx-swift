# vMLX Swift Completion Audit - 2026-05-16

This audit turns `goal.md` into a concrete completion checklist for the
consolidated `vmlx-swift` engine. It is intentionally conservative: a row is
only `live-proven`, `unit-tested`, or `static-proven` when there is a real local
artifact or source reference. Everything else stays `open`.

Current pushed branch state:

- Branch: `vmlx-0.31.3`
- Latest pushed runtime checkpoint entering the guard-removal/doc refresh:
  `b516f61`
  (`docs(runtime): record dsv4 cache and long-context gates`)
- Prior non-MTP checkpoints in this pass: `50df533`, `0deb14b`,
  `6e435d7`, `7962647`, `9a56de1`, and `ed04161`.
- Previous MTP runtime checkpoint: `0fdb164`
  (`feat(runtime): add exact native mtp sampling`)
- Current worktree is not clean because another agent is working on Flux-native
  Swift files. The dirty Flux files are excluded from this audit's commit scope.
- Current non-MTP focus: DSV4 Flash, Nemotron Omni, ZAYA1-VL, cache/template
  correctness, and live coherent multi-turn rows. Native MTP is parked for this
  pass.

## Objective Restated as Deliverables

The package is complete only when all of these are true:

1. `vmlx-swift` is the single Swift package surface Osaurus can pin instead of
   separately pinning `vmlx-swift-lm`, `mlx-swift`, `swift-transformers`, and
   Jinja.
2. All runtime surfaces have live or unit-test evidence: model loading, chat
   templates, generation config, reasoning modes, tool parsers, VL/audio/media,
   cache topology, continuous batching, TurboQuant/JANGTQ, MTP, and distributed
   stubs.
3. Every local model family under `~/models` has a status row with load,
   template, generation, multi-turn, cache, batching, speed, and result.
4. Cache behavior is topology-specific: no generic paged/prefix hit is accepted
   for DSV4 CSA/HSA/SWA, ZAYA CCA, Qwen hybrid SSM, VL/media, audio, or other
   path-dependent state.
5. No fake runtime guard is used to hide bad behavior. No hidden repetition
   penalty, no forced think close, no forced stop, no hidden reasoning downgrade,
   and no all-or-nothing MTP acceptance.
6. Osaurus wiring is mapped and later repinned only after the package evidence
   is strong enough.
7. All claims are pushed, committed, and documented with exact local artifact
   paths for raw logs that cannot be committed.

## Prompt-to-Artifact Checklist

| Requirement from `goal.md` | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check repo/process state before long tests. | `pgrep` checks before/after recent RunBench/test work; no `RunBench`/Swift build/test processes running after latest push. | live-proven |
| Do not overwrite unrelated work. | Current dirty files are Flux-owned (`Package.swift`, `Libraries/VMLX/VMLX.swift`, `Libraries/vMLXFlux*`, `Tests/vMLXFluxTests`, `tools/vMLXFluxProbe`) and were left unstaged. | live-proven |
| Package graph should consolidate MLX/Jinja/Transformers-style code. | `Package.swift` at pushed HEAD exposes products `MLX`, `Jinja`, `Tokenizers`, `MLXLMCommon`, `MLXLLM`, `MLXVLM`, `MLXPress`, and `VMLX`; `Libraries/VMLX/VMLX.swift` re-exports the stable Osaurus import surface. | static-proven |
| Osaurus current pin/wiring map. | `docs/VMLX_OSAURUS_CONSOLIDATION_AUDIT_2026_05_15.md`; current OsaurusCore pins are `mlx-swift=0a56f904`, `vmlx-swift-lm=2cc64dd`, `Jinja=58d21aa`, `swift-transformers=087a66b`. | static-proven |
| Compare `../vmlx-swift-lm`. | `docs/VMLX_SWIFT_LM_DEEP_COMPARISON_2026_05_15.md` plus updated consolidation audit. Sibling is dirty and behind origin; do not copy blindly. | static-proven |
| Local model inventory. | `docs/VMLX_LIVE_MODEL_MATRIX_2026_05_15.md`; local `find ~/models -maxdepth 4 -name config.json` shows DSV4, Hy3, Kimi, Laguna, MiniMax, ZAYA/ZAYA-VL, Qwen3.5/3.6, Gemma4, Ling, and Nemotron Omni families. | static-proven |
| Live infer matrix for installed models. | `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260515Tinfer-under20/REPORT.md` and `status.tsv`. Many under-20GB rows passed; several rows failed or were skipped. | partial |
| MTP activation must use real tensor evidence, not names. | `9b1b254`; `docs/VMLX_SWIFT_MTP_OSAURUS_WIRING_2026_05_15.md`; local fail-closed artifact `docs/local/native-mtp-qwen36-20260515/jang4m-crack-native-mtp-denied-postrevert.log`. | live-proven |
| MTP depth-3 production acceleration. | Current D3 rows prove recursive draft plus accepted-prefix cache commit, but remain below the 50 tok/s production target. Small-M verifier tuning is still open. | open |
| Qwen3.6 MTP coherency and token/s. | D1 artifacts `jang4m-mtp-artifact-native-d1-postrevert-96.log` and `mx-mtp-artifact-native-d1-postrevert-96.log`: coherent, `30.2` and `34.0 tok/s` short rows. D3 prefix-commit artifacts under `docs/local/native-mtp-qwen36-20260516-d3-prefix-commit/`: coherent, `prefixCommit>0`, `rollbackRepair=0`, no loops. | live-proven for explicit MTP diagnostic rows |
| Qwen3.6 50 tok/s target. | Not achieved. Current rows are below target and the rejected verifier argmax experiment was not committed. | open |
| DSV4 native encoder, CSA/HSA/SWA, long context, vector drift. | New non-MTP DSV4 JANGTQ-K rows under `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tdsv4-nonmtp/` prove config/template, three-turn recall, reasoning off/on/max with rep=1.0, a 5.5k-token semantic recall row, and DSV4 paged-incompatible salted disk-cache restore. A 16k-token long-context row currently fails with Metal OOM, and the ds4 official vector fixture is not present locally. | partial/failing |
| Prefix cache OFF/ON and cache hit proof. | Existing matrix/harness describes rows; not complete for every topology and model family. | open |
| Paged cache OFF/ON. | Existing focused tests and some model rows exist, but no package-wide matrix artifact proves all relevant architectures. | open |
| Disk L2 OFF/ON and fresh-session restore. | Existing docs and some rows exist; package-wide, per-topology proof remains incomplete. | open |
| SSM companion cache and async rederive. | Qwen/hybrid rows are required by docs; not exhaustively live-proven for all relevant local models. | open |
| VL media salt, same-image hit, changed-image miss. | `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tzaya-vl-think-template-fix/ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4_vl_chat_cache.out`: same-media replay HIT, different-media MISS, coherent blue/orange follow-up. | live-proven for ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ4 |
| Nemotron Omni audio/Parakeet/RADIO. | Video generation now carries the processor's post-EVS keep count and applies real EVS before prompt splice. `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tomni-nonmtp/Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK_omni_evs_v2.out` passes 13/13 TokenIterator rows; strict pre-fix artifact `..._omni_strict.out` failed the video row. The second fix canonicalizes the closed no-thinking media tail to `<think>\n</think>\n\n`; tail probe `..._omni_tail_probe.out` proves compact tail fails and spaced tail grounds the same image, and `..._omni_batch_nothink_tail_fix.out` passes 18/18 including direct and BatchEngine image with `enable_thinking=false`. | live-proven for Omni JANGTQ4 |
| Reasoning on/off/effort matrix. | Focused DSV4 pass-through exists. MiniMax Small now has live thinking ON/OFF alternation with `.reasoning` deltas ON and zero reasoning OFF. Ling/Bailing template has no active thinking rail in this bundle and returns visible content with no marker leak. Full model-family reasoning-effort matrix is not complete. | partial |
| Tool parser matrix by family. | DSV4 and selected templates have focused proof; full dsml/deepseek/gemma4/kimi/jang/zaya/llama/qwen/mistral matrix remains open. | open |
| Generation config defaults apply. | `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/Ling-2.6-flash-JANGTQ2-CRACK_prod_bundle_defaults_coord.out` proves the Ling folder has no sampling defaults and resolves through fallback to `temp=0.600 topP=1.000 topK=0 minP=0.000 rep=nil`. `.../MiniMax-M2.7-Small-JANGTQ_prod_bundle_defaults_coord.out` proves MiniMax's `generation_config.json` applies `temp=1.000 topP=0.950 topK=40 rep=nil`. `.../Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-JANG_4M-CRACK_prod_bundle_defaults_coord.out` proves Gemma 4's folder config applies `temp=1.000 topP=0.950 topK=64 rep=nil`. Package-wide override matrix remains incomplete. | partial |
| Single-batch and continuous batching. | Omni BatchEngine harness now forces `maxBatchSize=2` for B=1 rows so it exercises the scheduler path instead of the solo fast path. Text B=1, text B=2, image B=1, and audio B=1 pass after the no-thinking media-tail fix in `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tomni-nonmtp/Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK_omni_batch_nothink_tail_fix.out`. Ling and MiniMax Small have coordinated `BENCH_PROD` rows with same-prompt TTFT checks. Full per-family B>1 batching remains incomplete. | live-proven for Omni JANGTQ4; package-wide partial |
| TurboQuant/JANGTQ encode/decode and acceleration toggles. | Focused JANGTQ/Hadamard/matmul proof exists; live low-footprint active routed expert pass for all relevant models remains open. | open |
| Distributed mode. | Targets exist (`MLXDistributed*`, `TPRankWorker`), but no no-peer distributed clean artifact is recorded for this audit. | open |
| Full `swift test`. | Full package test remains open, but the local `Testing`/`XCTest` import blocker was narrowed to the shell toolchain/framework search path, not source. The passing local invocation is `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcrun swift test ... -Xswiftc -F -Xswiftc /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/Library/Frameworks`. Focused artifacts: `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tnonmtp-tests/NemotronHOmniPreEncodedAudioTests_expanded_xcode.out` and the MLXPress policy run from the same invocation. The wired Omni focused suite now covers 7 rows: live audio buffer, pre-encoded Parakeet embedding, video EVS token count, RADIO pixel shuffle, Parakeet relative shift, projector remaps, and Parakeet weight transpose. `Tests/MLXLMTests/NemotronHOmniSmokeTests.swift` is currently not wired into an active package test target, so the earlier filtered row that ran 0 tests is not counted. | partial |
| Release build. | `swift build -c release --product RunBench --jobs 2` passed after the non-MTP Omni tail fix; artifact: `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tnonmtp-tests/RunBench_release_build.out`. | live-proven |
| Osaurus single-package repin. | Not done. Osaurus still pins split runtime stack. | open |

## Current Model Matrix Snapshot

Local raw matrix: `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260515Tinfer-under20/`.

Notable pass rows:

- Laguna XS.2 JANGTQ config/template/prod defaults.
- ZAYA text JANGTQ4, JANGTQ_K, and MXFP4 config/template/prod defaults.
- ZAYA-VL config/template and VL batch chat rows.
- Qwen3.5 35B A3B config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.
- Gemma4 JANG_4M config/template/prod defaults.
- Nemotron Omni JANGTQ/JANGTQ4 config/template/prod defaults/Omni rows.
- Qwen3.6 27B JANG_4M CRACK and JANG_4M MTP config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.
- Qwen3.6 27B MXFP4 CRACK config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.
- Qwen3.6 35B A3B JANGTQ config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.

Known failing rows from that snapshot:

- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP_.infer_vl_batch_chat` -> `fail:133`

2026-05-16 non-MTP ZAYA1-VL follow-up:

- Root cause for JANGTQ4/MXFP4 text failures was not sampling and not a model
  quality issue: the loader shim manufactured a Qwen-style `<think>` assistant
  prefill even though ZAYA1-VL bundles stamp `think_in_template=false` and their
  shipped VL sidecar generation prompt is plain `<|im_start|>assistant\n`.
- Fix scope: ZAYA1-VL metadata shim still materializes vision placeholders and
  Zyphra XML tools, but no longer emits `<think>` or `enable_thinking` rails.
  The production harness now probes the actual rendered prompt before requiring
  `.reasoning` deltas; non-toggleable templates must still produce visible,
  coherent output with no marker leak.
- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4` now passes `BENCH_TEMPLATE_SMOKE=1`,
  `BENCH_PROD=1`, and `BENCH_VL_CHAT_CACHE=1`:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tzaya-vl-think-template-fix/ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4_template_smoke.out`,
  `.../ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4_prod_postharness.out`, and
  `.../ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4_vl_chat_cache.out`.
- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4` now passes `BENCH_PROD=1` at
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tzaya-vl-think-template-fix/ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4_prod.out`.
- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K` remains blocked: bundle-default sampling and explicit
  greedy both fail the same `7+8-11` row (`7`/`8` stochastic, `6` greedy) while
  other short rows pass. Artifacts:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tzaya-vl-think-template-fix/ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_prod.out`
  and `.../ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_prod_greedy.out`. Do not call this variant
  production-ready until the quant/runtime cause is found.
- Follow-up on `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K` narrows the failure away from cache,
  streaming, parser, EOS, and sampler policy. The real prompt/logit probe at
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tzaya-vl-jangtqk-debug/ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_topk_math.out`
  uses the same rendered prompt and token IDs as JANGTQ4/MXFP4, but the K
  bundle ranks `6`, `7`, `8`, then the correct `4` on the first assistant
  token. JANGTQ4 and MXFP4 rank `4` first in
  `.../ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4_topk_math.out` and
  `.../ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4_topk_math.out`.
- Runtime metadata is not the remaining K bug: the diagnostic at
  `.../ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_moe_bits_v2.out` loads the real model and reflects
  all 40 `TurboQuantSwitchGLU` modules as `gateUp=2`, `down=4`, `seed=42`.
  The `BENCH_ZAYA_CONTRACT` gate was corrected to understand ZAYA1-VL's
  40-layer CCA+MoE topology and vision-LoRA `local_experts`; K, JANGTQ4, and
  MXFP4 now pass contract at `.../*_contract_v2.out`.
- The remaining K blocker is also not explained by the Swift Metal mixed-bit
  JANGTQ kernels. `BENCH_ZAYA_TQ_KERNEL_PROBE=1` loads actual
  `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K` layer tensors plus the real sidecar and compares
  gate/up 2-bit, fused SwiGLU, and down 4-bit kernels against a CPU dequant
  reference. Single-layer proof:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tzaya-vl-jangtqk-debug/ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_tq_kernel_probe.out`.
  Cross-layer proof:
  `.../ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_tq_kernel_probe_layers.out` covers layers
  `0,1,10,20,39` and experts `0,7,15`; all max diffs are about `1e-5`.
  Treat the math-row failure as a real K artifact/runtime-quality blocker until
  a packer-side dequant comparison or a rebuilt K bundle proves otherwise. Do
  not add a sampler/template guard for it.

2026-05-16 non-MTP DSV4 follow-up:

- Config/template gates pass for the local DSV4 Flash JANGTQ-K and JANGTQ2
  bundles:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tdsv4-nonmtp/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K_config_smoke.out`,
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ2_config_smoke.out`,
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K_template_kwargs.out`, and
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ2_template_kwargs.out`.
- JANGTQ-K three-turn chat is coherent with thinking disabled and recalls the
  injected `sapphire-42` token:
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K_coherence_chat.out`.
- Reasoning off/on/max with explicit `repetition_penalty=1.0` answers `12`,
  does not need a hidden sampler floor, and does not leak raw reasoning tags:
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K_coherence_reasoning_rep1.out`.
- A 5.5k-token semantic recall row returns `CERULEAN RIVER and OSLO`, but it is
  slow (`~0.07 tok/s`) and is not a substitute for the full DSV4 B7
  long-context/vector drift gate:
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K_coherence_long.out`.
- Current DSV4 cache-topology proof:
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K_growing_chat_cache_current.out` and
  `.err`. It reports `pagedIncompatible=true`, salted prompt/post-answer disk
  hits with `diskArrays=yes`, nil-salt misses, and a coherent turn-2 recall.
  Prompt prefill time drops from `15.423s` to `0.307s`.
- Current DSV4 long-context blocker:
  `.../DeepSeek-V4-Flash-JANGTQ-K_coherence_long_16k_current.out` prepares a
  `16318` token prompt, then `.err` fails with Metal
  `kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorOutOfMemory`. Do not claim DSV4 long-context
  production readiness until the memory path is fixed and rerun.
- The Python ds4 official vector fixture expected by
  `tests/cross_matrix/dsv4_vector_probe.py` was not present at
  `/tmp/ds4-read/tests/test-vectors/official.vec` on this machine, so the
  vector-drift row remains explicitly blocked rather than inferred.

2026-05-16 non-MTP Ling/MiniMax guard-removal follow-up:

- A new diagnostic harness, `BENCH_NO_GUARD_SAMPLING=1`, was added to
  `RunBench/Bench.swift`. It is test-only and does not modify production
  defaults. It prints the rendered prompt tail and effective request sampling
  values, then fails on empty visible output, repeated-output loops, repeated
  BOS tokens, visible reasoning-marker leaks, or unclosed reasoning when
  thinking is explicitly enabled.
- Ling/Bailing explicit no-guard evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/Ling-2.6-flash-JANGTQ2-CRACK_no_guard_sampling.out`.
  The three live calls use `rep=nil` for greedy "say hi", explicit `rep=1.000`
  for the temp-0.6 star story, and `temp=0.700 topP=1.000 topK=0 minP=0.000
  rep=nil` for the Russian Three.js stress prompt. All stop normally with no
  loops, no BOS repetition, no raw reasoning marker leaks, and measured decode
  around `35-37 tok/s`.
- Ling caveat: the Russian Three.js stress row is on-task and non-looping, but
  it contains one Chinese token (`点位`) inside an otherwise Russian response.
  That is recorded as a quality caveat, not hidden by a top-p/repetition
  fallback. The bundle's `generation_config.json` has no sampling defaults, so
  the resolved production fallback is genuinely `temp=0.600 topP=1.000 topK=0
  minP=0.000 rep=nil`.
- Ling coordinated bundle-default evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/Ling-2.6-flash-JANGTQ2-CRACK_prod_bundle_defaults_coord.out`
  passes 7/7 with an explicit cache coordinator and the same resolved fallback
  values. Same-prompt TTFT drops from `284ms` to `193ms`.
- MiniMax Small explicit no-guard evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/MiniMax-M2.7-Small-JANGTQ_no_guard_sampling.out`.
  Greedy/no-rep "say hi" returns visible `Hi!`; the temp-0.6, explicit
  `rep=1.000`, thinking-on story returns visible content about a star, `.reasoning`
  is separated, no markers leak, and decode is about `46-47 tok/s`.
- MiniMax Small coordinated bundle-default evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/MiniMax-M2.7-Small-JANGTQ_prod_bundle_defaults_coord.out`
  passes 7/7 and proves its folder `generation_config.json` values apply:
  `temp=1.000 topP=0.950 topK=40 minP=0.000 rep=nil`. Same-prompt TTFT drops
  from `385ms` to `67ms`, and reasoning ON/OFF alternation is correct.

2026-05-16 non-MTP Gemma 4 follow-up:

- Gemma 4 coordinated bundle-default evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-JANG_4M-CRACK_prod_bundle_defaults_coord.out`
  passes 7/7 with an explicit cache coordinator. The resolved sampling line
  proves the folder `generation_config.json` is used:
  `temp=1.000 topP=0.950 topK=64 minP=0.000 rep=nil`. Same-prompt TTFT drops
  from `458ms` to `63ms`; Harmony reasoning is separated from visible content,
  and thinking-off rows emit zero reasoning.
- Gemma 4 explicit no-guard evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/Gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-JANG_4M-CRACK_no_guard_sampling_768_unclosed_loopheuristic.out`
  and `.err`. Greedy/no-rep "say hi" is coherent. The thinking-on star-story
  stress row fails honestly: at `maxTokens=768`, `temp=0.600 topP=1.000 topK=0
  minP=0.000 rep=1.000`, it emits reasoning only, hits length, and produces no
  visible answer. This is not hidden by a forced close or repetition floor.
- The failure exposed a terminal-info bug in the shared solo generation loop:
  public `BatchEngine.generate`/solo-fast-path info was snapshotting after
  parser flush and could report `unclosedReasoning=NO` even when the parser
  was still inside Harmony reasoning. `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Evaluate.swift`
  now snapshots `handler.unclosedReasoning` before `handler.onGenerationEnd`.
  Focused proof:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tguard-removal/NoHiddenReasoningCloseBiasFocusedTests_unclosed_info.out`.
- The diagnostic loop heuristic now also catches long repeated non-whitespace
  scalar runs, so numeric/token-salad tails are not missed merely because they
  are not repeated word spans.

2026-05-16 non-MTP Nemotron Omni follow-up:

- The strict pre-fix artifact
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tomni-nonmtp/Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK_omni_strict.out`
  failed `5b. video LMInput end-to-end` with a repeated filler loop. That was a
  real runtime bug, not model quality.
- The fix carries the processor's post-EVS video token count through
  `LMInput.ProcessedVideo`, then applies RADIO video embedding, pixel shuffle,
  MLP projection, and EVS before LM prompt splice. The prompt placeholder count
  now matches the post-EVS embedding count, so video placeholders and embeddings
  stay one-to-one even if the EVS keep count changes.
- Post-fix TokenIterator evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tomni-nonmtp/Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK_omni_evs_v2.out`
  passes 13/13 text, image, video, audio, reasoning toggle, mixed media,
  media-salt isolation, and hybrid SSM warm-pass rows.
- BatchEngine evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tomni-nonmtp/Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK_omni_batch_forced_evs_v3.out`
  passes text B=1, text B=2, and audio B=1 through a forced scheduler path, but
  fails image B=1 because the model says the image is blank or missing when
  `enable_thinking=false`. This is now correctly caught as a failure instead of
  counted as a false pass. Do not hide it by forcing reasoning on.
- The direct tail probe
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tomni-nonmtp/Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK_omni_tail_probe.out`
  proves the actual media no-thinking contract: compact `<think></think>` and
  `<think></think>\n` both fail with the missing-image denial, while the closed
  newline-delimited tail `<think>\n</think>\n\n` grounds the same prepared image
  tensor. This is a prompt-rendering correction, not a hidden reasoning override.
- Post-tail-fix BatchEngine evidence:
  `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260516Tomni-nonmtp/Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK_omni_batch_nothink_tail_fix.out`
  passes 18/18. The direct `3b. image reasoning OFF direct` row returns a
  grounded gradient description at `96.6 tok/s`; `B3. BatchEngine image B=1`
  returns the same grounded class of answer at `47.8 tok/s`.

Skipped rows because of the 20GB cutoff include DSV4 Flash, Hy3, Kimi,
MiniMax, Ling, and other large bundles. They are not production passes.

## Current MTP Boundary

Live-proven:

- MTP activation requires `VMLINUX_NATIVE_MTP=1`.
- Supported Qwen model types must expose real MTP tensor evidence.
- CRACK config metadata without tensors fails closed.
- Qwen3.6 MTP proof targets are
  `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-27B-JANG_4M-MTP` and
  `/Users/eric/models/JANGQ/Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP`.
- Qwen3.6 JANG_4M-MTP and MXFP4-MTP D1 smokes are coherent with telemetry.
- Qwen3.6 D3 prefix-commit smokes are coherent on both proof targets:
  `docs/local/native-mtp-qwen36-20260516-d3-prefix-commit/jang4m-mtp-d3-prefix-commit-no-checkpoint-256.log`
  and
  `docs/local/native-mtp-qwen36-20260516-d3-prefix-commit/mxfp4-mtp-d3-prefix-commit-no-checkpoint-256.log`.
  Both rows report `rollbackRepair=0`.
- MTP phase telemetry now reports target verify, MTP draft, sampling, and cache
  commit time. The 2026-05-16 phase rows show target verify dominates, so the
  next speed pass must focus on compiled/tuned small-M verifier execution.

Not yet complete:

- Production-speed depth-3 acceleration near the 50 tok/s target.
- Compiled/tuned small-M verifier.
- MTP with VL multi-turn/media salt/cache proof.
- Auto-launch eligibility for Osaurus.

## Immediate Next Gates

1. Continue diagnosing the remaining `fail:133` rows without MTP scope:
   `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K` is still a real coherence failure on one math row,
   but the Swift mixed-bit JANGTQ kernel path now has actual-tensor CPU parity
   proof. The next useful check is packer-side/reference dequant comparison or a
   rebuilt K artifact, not a runtime sampler workaround. The JANGTQ4/MXFP4
   ZAYA1-VL text-template failures are fixed and live-proven.
2. Finish migrating any still-useful lightweight rows from
   `Tests/MLXLMTests/NemotronHOmniSmokeTests.swift` into an active test target.
   The critical EVS/remap/shape rows are now covered by
   `NemotronHOmniPreEncodedAudioTests`; the remaining unwired file should either
   be deleted, wired, or reduced to non-duplicated coverage.
3. Extend the Omni-style no-thinking media-tail gate to any other local
   multimodal reasoning model that shows the same compact-tail failure. Do not
   assume it globally; prove it per family with a direct media tensor row.
4. Run a clean-worktree focused test pass once Flux Package.swift edits are
   either committed by the Flux agent or isolated in a separate worktree.
5. MTP is parked for this non-MTP production pass. Do not spend current
   validation time on MTP unless the user re-opens that scope.
6. Fix DSV4 16k+ long-context memory behavior, then rerun B7-style
   long-context and vector drift. Current pushed engine passes the DSV4 disk
   restore/cache topology row but fails the 16k long-context row with Metal OOM;
   the ds4 official vector fixture is also absent locally.
7. Expand the model matrix beyond the 20GB cutoff for DSV4, MiniMax, Ling, Hy3,
   and Kimi one family at a time, with process checks before and after each run.

## Mergeability Call

Current state: **not release-ready and not complete**.

The package has useful pushed progress, especially consolidated product surface
work, MTP tensor-gated activation, and many local model smokes. It still has
uncovered or failing requirements in the model matrix, cache topology matrix,
full test graph, Osaurus repin, DSV4 long-context proof, VL text-path failures,
and production MTP D3 acceleration.
