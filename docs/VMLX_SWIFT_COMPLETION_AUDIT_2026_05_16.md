# vMLX Swift Completion Audit - 2026-05-16

This audit turns `goal.md` into a concrete completion checklist for the
consolidated `vmlx-swift` engine. It is intentionally conservative: a row is
only `live-proven`, `unit-tested`, or `static-proven` when there is a real local
artifact or source reference. Everything else stays `open`.

Current pushed branch state:

- Branch: `vmlx-0.31.3`
- Pushed HEAD: `4e53670` (`docs(runtime): refresh osaurus consolidation audit`)
- Previous runtime commit: `9b1b254` (`feat(runtime): add tensor-gated qwen native mtp`)
- Current worktree is not clean because another agent is working on Flux-native
  Swift files. The dirty Flux files are excluded from this audit's commit scope.

## Objective Restated as Deliverables

The package is complete only when all of these are true:

1. `vmlx-swift` is the single Swift package surface Osaurus can pin instead of
   separately pinning `vmlx-swift-lm`, `mlx-swift`, `swift-transformers`, and
   Jinja.
2. All runtime surfaces have live or unit-test evidence: model loading, chat
   templates, generation config, reasoning modes, tool parsers, VL/audio/media,
   cache topology, continuous batching, TurboQuant/JANGTQ, MTP, and distributed
   stubs.
3. Every local model family under `~/models` has a status row with load,
   template, generation, multi-turn, cache, batching, speed, and result.
4. Cache behavior is topology-specific: no generic paged/prefix hit is accepted
   for DSV4 CSA/HSA/SWA, ZAYA CCA, Qwen hybrid SSM, VL/media, audio, or other
   path-dependent state.
5. No fake runtime guard is used to hide bad behavior. No hidden repetition
   penalty, no forced think close, no forced stop, no hidden reasoning downgrade,
   and no all-or-nothing MTP acceptance.
6. Osaurus wiring is mapped and later repinned only after the package evidence
   is strong enough.
7. All claims are pushed, committed, and documented with exact local artifact
   paths for raw logs that cannot be committed.

## Prompt-to-Artifact Checklist

| Requirement from `goal.md` | Current evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check repo/process state before long tests. | `pgrep` checks before/after recent RunBench/test work; no `RunBench`/Swift build/test processes running after latest push. | live-proven |
| Do not overwrite unrelated work. | Current dirty files are Flux-owned (`Package.swift`, `Libraries/VMLX/VMLX.swift`, `Libraries/vMLXFlux*`, `Tests/vMLXFluxTests`, `tools/vMLXFluxProbe`) and were left unstaged. | live-proven |
| Package graph should consolidate MLX/Jinja/Transformers-style code. | `Package.swift` at pushed HEAD exposes products `MLX`, `Jinja`, `Tokenizers`, `MLXLMCommon`, `MLXLLM`, `MLXVLM`, `MLXPress`, and `VMLX`; `Libraries/VMLX/VMLX.swift` re-exports the stable Osaurus import surface. | static-proven |
| Osaurus current pin/wiring map. | `docs/VMLX_OSAURUS_CONSOLIDATION_AUDIT_2026_05_15.md`; current OsaurusCore pins are `mlx-swift=0a56f904`, `vmlx-swift-lm=2cc64dd`, `Jinja=58d21aa`, `swift-transformers=087a66b`. | static-proven |
| Compare `../vmlx-swift-lm`. | `docs/VMLX_SWIFT_LM_DEEP_COMPARISON_2026_05_15.md` plus updated consolidation audit. Sibling is dirty and behind origin; do not copy blindly. | static-proven |
| Local model inventory. | `docs/VMLX_LIVE_MODEL_MATRIX_2026_05_15.md`; local `find ~/models -maxdepth 4 -name config.json` shows DSV4, Hy3, Kimi, Laguna, MiniMax, ZAYA/ZAYA-VL, Qwen3.5/3.6, Gemma4, Ling, and Nemotron Omni families. | static-proven |
| Live infer matrix for installed models. | `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260515Tinfer-under20/REPORT.md` and `status.tsv`. Many under-20GB rows passed; several rows failed or were skipped. | partial |
| MTP activation must use real tensor evidence, not names. | `9b1b254`; `docs/VMLX_SWIFT_MTP_OSAURUS_WIRING_2026_05_15.md`; local fail-closed artifact `docs/local/native-mtp-qwen36-20260515/jang4m-crack-native-mtp-denied-postrevert.log`. | live-proven |
| MTP depth-3 production acceleration. | Current D2/D3 rows are coherent correctness probes only. Doc explicitly says proper D3 still requires capture/commit and small-M verify. | open |
| Qwen3.6 MTP coherency and token/s. | Local artifacts `jang4m-mtp-artifact-native-d1-postrevert-96.log` and `mx-mtp-artifact-native-d1-postrevert-96.log`: coherent, `stop=stop`, `loop=NO`, `30.2` and `34.0 tok/s` short rows. | live-proven for D1 smoke only |
| Qwen3.6 50 tok/s target. | Not achieved. Current rows are below target and the rejected verifier argmax experiment was not committed. | open |
| DSV4 native encoder, CSA/HSA/SWA, long context, vector drift. | Focused docs exist in `docs/VMLX_SWIFT_PRODUCTION_ENGINE_GATE.md`, but current full long-context/vector gate is still listed open in consolidation audit. | open |
| Prefix cache OFF/ON and cache hit proof. | Existing matrix/harness describes rows; not complete for every topology and model family. | open |
| Paged cache OFF/ON. | Existing focused tests and some model rows exist, but no package-wide matrix artifact proves all relevant architectures. | open |
| Disk L2 OFF/ON and fresh-session restore. | Existing docs and some rows exist; package-wide, per-topology proof remains incomplete. | open |
| SSM companion cache and async rederive. | Qwen/hybrid rows are required by docs; not exhaustively live-proven for all relevant local models. | open |
| VL media salt, same-image hit, changed-image miss. | Some VL rows pass; current infer matrix has ZAYA-VL text prod rows failing with status 133 while VL batch chat rows pass. Needs diagnosis, not a pass. | open |
| Nemotron Omni audio/Parakeet/RADIO. | `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260515Tinfer-under20/` has Omni JANGTQ and JANGTQ4 `infer_omni` pass rows. Chunk-concat safety remains documented as not proven. | partial |
| Reasoning on/off/effort matrix. | Focused DSV4 pass-through exists; full model-family reasoning matrix is not complete. | open |
| Tool parser matrix by family. | DSV4 and selected templates have focused proof; full dsml/deepseek/gemma4/kimi/jang/zaya/llama/qwen/mistral matrix remains open. | open |
| Generation config defaults apply. | Harness supports resolved defaults; package-wide three-bundle proof and per-model override matrix remain incomplete. | open |
| Single-batch and continuous batching. | Batch harness exists; full B=1/B>1 overlap and isolation proof per family remains incomplete. | open |
| TurboQuant/JANGTQ encode/decode and acceleration toggles. | Focused JANGTQ/Hadamard/matmul proof exists; live low-footprint active routed expert pass for all relevant models remains open. | open |
| Distributed mode. | Targets exist (`MLXDistributed*`, `TPRankWorker`), but no no-peer distributed clean artifact is recorded for this audit. | open |
| Full `swift test`. | Current dirty worktree test attempt failed before MTP tests because package/test graph compiled `MLXPressPolicyTests` with `no such module 'Testing'` under the active command. This is a blocker, not a pass. | open |
| Release build. | `swift build -c release --product RunBench --jobs 2` passed after MTP changes. | live-proven |
| Osaurus single-package repin. | Not done. Osaurus still pins split runtime stack. | open |

## Current Model Matrix Snapshot

Local raw matrix: `docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260515Tinfer-under20/`.

Notable pass rows:

- Laguna XS.2 JANGTQ config/template/prod defaults.
- ZAYA text JANGTQ4, JANGTQ_K, and MXFP4 config/template/prod defaults.
- ZAYA-VL config/template and VL batch chat rows.
- Qwen3.5 35B A3B config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.
- Gemma4 JANG_4M config/template/prod defaults.
- Nemotron Omni JANGTQ/JANGTQ4 config/template/prod defaults/Omni rows.
- Qwen3.6 27B JANG_4M CRACK and JANG_4M MTP config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.
- Qwen3.6 27B MXFP4 CRACK config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.
- Qwen3.6 35B A3B JANGTQ config/template/prod defaults/VL batch chat.

Known failing rows from that snapshot:

- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ4_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-JANGTQ_K_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `ZAYA1-VL-8B-MXFP4_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP_.infer_prod_defaults_cache_off` -> `fail:133`
- `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP_.infer_vl_batch_chat` -> `fail:133`

Skipped rows because of the 20GB cutoff include DSV4 Flash, Hy3, Kimi,
MiniMax, Ling, and other large bundles. They are not production passes.

## Current MTP Boundary

Live-proven:

- MTP activation requires `VMLINUX_NATIVE_MTP=1`.
- Supported Qwen model types must expose real MTP tensor evidence.
- CRACK config metadata without tensors fails closed.
- Qwen3.6 JANG_4M-MTP and MXFP4-MTP D1 smokes are coherent with telemetry.

Not yet complete:

- Proper depth-3 acceleration.
- Capture/commit for Qwen hybrid SSM/KV accepted prefixes.
- Compiled/tuned small-M verifier.
- MTP with VL multi-turn/media salt/cache proof.
- MTP speed target near 50 tok/s.
- Auto-launch eligibility for Osaurus.

## Immediate Next Gates

1. Diagnose the `fail:133` rows in the existing under-20GB matrix, starting with
   `Qwen3.6-27B-MXFP4-MTP` and ZAYA-VL prod-default text rows. These are current
   live failures and should not be hidden.
2. Run a clean-worktree focused test pass once Flux Package.swift edits are
   either committed by the Flux agent or isolated in a separate worktree.
3. Start native MTP D3 implementation only after recording the current
   correctness baseline: target verifier capture/commit API, Qwen Mamba/KV
   checkpoint shape, and small-M verifier instrumentation.
4. Run DSV4 long-context/vector drift with current pushed engine.
5. Expand the model matrix beyond the 20GB cutoff for DSV4, MiniMax, Ling, Hy3,
   and Kimi one family at a time, with process checks before and after each run.

## Mergeability Call

Current state: **not release-ready and not complete**.

The package has useful pushed progress, especially consolidated product surface
work, MTP tensor-gated activation, and many local model smokes. It still has
uncovered or failing requirements in the model matrix, cache topology matrix,
full test graph, Osaurus repin, DSV4 long-context proof, VL text-path failures,
and production MTP D3 acceleration.
