# vMLX Server Panel Engine Contract - 2026-05-15

This records the engine-side contract for the Osaurus server-oriented panel.
The source of truth is `VMLXServerRuntimeSettings` in `MLXLMCommon`; the UI
should persist and send that shape instead of inventing panel-only flags.

## Core Rule

Every knob is either an explicit user override or `nil` / `auto` / `engineSelected`.
The engine must not turn a failing model row into a pass by silently adding
sampling clamps, hidden EOS guards, forced reasoning closure, or cache-disabled
fallbacks.

## Panel Mapping

| Panel section | Engine type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server Settings | `VMLXServerNetworkSettings` | Host, port, optional API key, served name, rate limit, timeout, log level, CORS. |
| Concurrent Processing | `VMLXServerConcurrencySettings` | Continuous batching stays on by default because it is the gateway to prefix reuse, paged KV, block disk L2, and architecture-specific restore. |
| Prefix Cache | `VMLXPrefixCacheSettings` | Memory limit can be explicit MB, percent, or engine default. TTL `nil` means no expiration. |
| Paged KV Cache | `VMLXPagedKVCacheSettings` | Mutually exclusive with legacy prompt disk cache. Persistent paged cache uses block disk L2. |
| KV Cache Quantization | `VMLXKVCacheCodec`, `turboQuantKeyBits`, `turboQuantValueBits`, and `VMLXStoredKVCacheCodec` | Live codec and stored codec are separate so TurboQuant KV can be live while disk storage remains engine-selected. TurboQuant live KV requires explicit key/value bit widths. |
| Disk Cache | `VMLXDiskCacheSettings` | Legacy prompt disk cache only. The validator errors if this runs with paged KV. |
| Block Disk Cache L2 | `VMLXBlockDiskCacheSettings` | Persistent cache layer for paged KV and architecture-specific cache blocks. |
| Power Management | `VMLXServerPowerSettings` | JIT load, wake-on-request, light sleep, deep sleep. Deep sleep must be later than light sleep. |
| Performance & Generation | `VMLXServerGenerationDefaults` | `nil` means bundle metadata first, then documented engine fallback. Do not write hidden default sampling guards here. |
| Tool Integration | `VMLXServerToolSettings` | MCP config, auto tool choice, parser overrides, reasoning parser override, optional custom template. |
| Multimodal Support | `VMLXServerMultimodalSettings` | Auto/force off/force on VLM mode plus video/audio toggles and media-salt cache requirement. |
| Speculative Decoding / MTP | `VMLXServerMTPSettings` | Auto launches native MTP only when real tensor evidence plus usable bundle-local `vmlx_mtp_tuning.json` resolve a launch depth. Force-on errors for metadata-only, missing-tuning, blocked-tuning, or unsupported profiles. |

The panel/server should validate each request against
`ModelRuntimeCapabilitySnapshot.validate(request:unknownPolicy:)` before it
routes plugin or multimodal traffic. The default validator is fail-closed:
explicitly unsupported lanes return `unsupported_modality`, unknown lanes return
`unknown_modality_support`, and the JSON/log fields contain only lane/support
metadata rather than prompt text, media bytes, or local paths.

## Gateway Runtime States

The server panel should expose each loaded model as a gateway session with at
least these states:

- `stopped`: no process/model resident.
- `loading`: loader or JIT load in progress.
- `ready`: model loaded and idle.
- `generating`: at least one request in flight.
- `lightSleeping`: allocator/cache pressure reduced, fast wake expected.
- `deepSleeping`: model weights unloaded or equivalent RAM release happened.
- `errored`: last load/generation failed with a structured error.

Sleep/wake is a lifecycle operation. It must not mutate sampling defaults,
parser selection, cache topology, or MTP mode.

## Sampling Defaults

Server settings are not a place to hide model-family behavior changes.
`VMLXServerRuntimeSettings.resolvedGenerateParameters(generationConfig:fallback:)`
is the server-side merge point:

1. Start from the caller fallback.
2. Apply the bundle's `generation_config.json`.
3. Apply only explicit server/UI overrides.

`nil temperature`, `nil topP`, `nil topK`, `nil minP`, and
`nil repetitionPenalty` mean "use the bundle generation config, then the
engine fallback if the bundle is silent." A requested greedy decode stays
greedy. A requested `repetitionPenalty = 1.0` is a no-op, not a signal to
install a family floor. If a family loops at a requested sampling point,
record the runtime failure and fix template/cache/position/state handling.

## Cache Topology Requirements

For each model row the panel should show the topology actually used:

- prefix cache enabled/disabled plus hits/misses;
- paged KV enabled/disabled plus block counts;
- block disk L2 enabled/disabled plus bytes written/read;
- TurboQuant KV live codec, if enabled;
- SSM companion cache hits/misses for hybrid SSM or linear-attention models;
- media salt behavior for VL/video/audio models;
- DSV4 CSA/HSA/SWA cache detail for DSV4-family models;
- active routed expert mode and physical footprint for JANGTQ/MoE models.

If a layer is not legitimate for a model, the row should say `N-A` with the
reason. Do not show a fake zero counter as a pass.

`VMLXServerRuntimeSettings.cacheCoordinatorConfig(...)` is the panel-to-engine
bridge. It maps paged cache, block-disk/legacy disk selection, disk max GB,
disk directory, SSM re-derive, model-key isolation, default max KV size, and
explicit TurboQuant KV bit widths into `CacheCoordinatorConfig`. If
`liveKVCodec == .turboQuant` but the bit widths are missing, validation errors
and the builder does not silently invent 3/3 or any other hidden codec.

## Batch Scheduler Requirements

Single-batch and multi-batch are different claims:

- B=1 proves the regular BatchEngine path can prefill, decode, stop, store,
  and stream coherently for one request.
- B>1 must prove live scheduler overlap with `activeCount >= 2`, per-slot
  sampler isolation, per-slot KV policy isolation, and no cross-slot token
  drift versus a deterministic B=1 reference.
- TurboQuant KV must be covered both as mixed plain/TQ slots and all-TQ slots.
- Disk L2 restore must be covered with a fresh coordinator/session, not only
  with a warm in-process paged cache.
- Hybrid SSM/linear-attention/CCA rows must carry the companion state or disk
  format-v2 state along with the KV arrays; a KV-only hit is a false positive.

## Multimodal/VL Requirements

VL models add cache and shape invariants beyond text:

- image/video/audio payloads must affect `mediaSalt`; text-only follow-up turns
  may have nil salt, but media turns with identical token IDs and different
  tensors must not alias;
- Qwen-style VL models need 3-axis MRoPE position IDs and image/video THW grid
  metadata to stay aligned with the text stream;
- restore paths must respect 2D vs 3D/4D tensor ranks before reading sequence
  dimensions, otherwise they must fall back to fresh prefill with an explicit
  artifacted miss;
- JANGTQ VL matmul/Hadamard paths must preserve rank-2, rank-3, and rank-4
  shapes through dense, routed, and vision-tower layers;
- MTP+VL is not considered live until draft text, media embeddings, media salt,
  and accepted-token base cache updates are all proven together.

## MTP Contract

`MTPBundleStatus.mode == preserved_enabled` means the bundle preserved MTP
metadata/tensors. The status must be derived from actual weight-map or
safetensors-header tensor names, not from model or directory names. If metadata
claims MTP but tensor names do not prove it, the server must surface
`metadata_only_missing_weights` and keep native MTP off.

For Qwen3.6/Qwen3.5 MTP-capable bundles, the server should call
`resolvedMTPLaunch(configData:jangConfig:status:)`,
`resolvedLoadConfiguration(base:configData:jangConfig:status:)`, and
`resolvedMTPDraftStrategy(configData:jangConfig:status:)` from the same
evidence snapshot. A real supported MTP bundle resolves to
`LoadConfiguration.nativeMTP=true` plus `.nativeMTP(depth:)` using the
bundle-local `vmlx_mtp_tuning.json` best depth. A non-MTP CRACK bundle,
metadata-only bundle, missing/unusable tuning row, or unsupported profile
resolves with native MTP off. This avoids the broken middle state where the
request asks for MTP but the loader scrubbed the sidecar weights.

For capability/status JSON, serialize `MTPBundleStatus.snapshot`; it includes
the computed tuning gates (`has_usable_native_mtp_tuning`, `can_auto_launch`,
and `requires_native_mtp_tuning_before_auto_launch`) that are not plain stored
fields on the raw status value. Missing bundle-local tuning is also present in
`config_evidence` as `tuning_file_missing=vmlx_mtp_tuning.json` when the bundle
metadata or tensor names indicate MTP compatibility.

MTP cache rules:

- draft cache is separate from base cache;
- rejected draft tokens never enter base KV/paged/disk state;
- only accepted tokens are appended to base cache;
- VL bundles with MTP must keep media embeddings, media salt, and draft text
  state separate.
- D2/D3 acceptance is prefix-length based, not binary. A verifier round that
  accepts `d1,d2` and rejects `d3` must commit cache state after
  `[primary,d1,d2]`.
- Osaurus should surface verify calls, accepted/drafted by depth, average
  committed tokens per verify, bonus tokens, corrections, phase timing, cache
  mode, and verifier kernel mode for any future MTP-on row.

## Live Proof Dependency

The panel should not claim a model/config is production-ready until the
corresponding artifact exists under `docs/local/live-model-matrix/` or an
equivalent Osaurus release gate. Required proof is live multi-turn output,
token/s telemetry, low physical footprint where relevant, and cache topology
hits for the model family.
