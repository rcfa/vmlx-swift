# vMLX Swift / Osaurus PR Engine Coverage Audit - 2026-05-18

This is the current crosswalk from recent user-authored Osaurus PRs and pinned
runtime libraries to `vmlx-swift` engine proof. It is intentionally stricter
than a package build: a row is not switch-ready unless the exact runtime surface
has model-aware cache proof, multi-turn coherency, visible stop behavior, and no
hidden sampler/parser guard.

Fresh inspection commands used in this pass:

```sh
gh pr list -R osaurus-ai/osaurus --author @me --state all --search "created:>=2026-04-24" --json number,title,state,url,headRefOid,updatedAt,mergedAt,closedAt,isDraft,mergeStateStatus --limit 100

Current `vmlx-swift` branch head at this refresh:

```

2026-05-18 continuation refresh:

- Live GitHub refresh at `2026-05-17 19:57 PDT` still returns 15
  user-authored Osaurus PRs in the 2026-04-24+ runtime-pin window. The
  crosswalk rows below cover each returned PR: #931, #932, #943, #944, #946,
  #953, #967, #990, #993, #998, #1037, #1057, #1066, #1073, and #1110.
- GitHub still reports Osaurus PR #1110 as open, non-draft, all checks green,
  and `mergeStateStatus=DIRTY`; do not treat it as merged switch state.
- Current `osaurus-staging` branch is `feat/dsv4-vmlx-pin` at
  `b0a96dd4 Wire native DSV4 tokenizer bridge`, with local uncommitted Osaurus
  edits present. Those local edits are not part of the pinned public PR state.
- Live compare refresh of the four pinned runtime repos found no topology change
  from the prior audit: `Jinja` is identical to default `main`,
  `vmlx-swift-lm` pin `2cc64dd` is two commits ahead of its default `main`,
  `swift-transformers` pin `087a66b` is still fork-diverged from tokenizer
  speed commits on default `main`, and `mlx-swift` pin `0a56f904` is still an
  Osaurus fork lane with stream/wired-limit work rather than upstream parity.
- Fresh `vmlx-swift` evidence added after the first audit:
  `20260518T_gemma4_e2b_refresh_no_fake_guards/` and
  `20260518T_ling_jangtq2_no_guard_refresh/`. Both prove no hidden sampler
  guard behavior; failures, where present, were harness/product-budget issues,
  not decode fixes.
- VLM JANG weight loading now matches the LLM factory and passes the real
  `quantizationContainer?.quantization` value into `loadWeights` instead of the
  deprecated `baseConfig.quantization` alias. This keeps MXFP4/MXFP8 group-size
  inference source-backed for VL/Omni bundles; it is not a sampler, parser, or
  EOS workaround. `swift build -c release --product RunBench` passed after the
  change.
- Release-mode Swift Testing initially failed before focused MLXLM tests because
  `MLXTests/WiredMemoryTests.swift` referenced DEBUG-only wired-memory event
  helpers. The tests are now explicitly DEBUG-gated with a release skip, keeping
  the production `WiredMemoryManager` event surface unchanged. Focused release
  tests now pass for `vlmJangLoadUsesQuantizationContainer` and
  `nilServerSamplingFieldsDoNotAddFakeGuards`.
- DSV4 reasoning policy no longer lets the deprecated
  `VMLINUX_DSV4_FORCE_DIRECT_RAIL` environment key silently override an explicit
  `reasoning_effort=max` request. The first red test proved the old behavior
  rewrote the request to `enable_thinking=false`; the fixed release test suite
  now passes 6/6 for `DeepseekV4ReasoningPolicyTests`.
- Qwen native-MTP auto-launch is now driven by the bundle-local
  `vmlx_mtp_tuning.json`. `MTPBundleInspector` reads the file into
  `MTPBundleStatus`, and `NativeMTPAutoDecodePolicy` returns a depth only when
  the tuning row is validated, output-equivalent, unblocked, and tensor-proven.
  The old hardcoded Qwen profile/depth rules are removed; local 27B MXFP4 proves
  `best_depth=2` is honored, and local 35B JANG_2K proves a blocked tuning row
  keeps auto-launch off.

2026-05-17 20:25 PDT live refresh:

- `gh pr list --repo osaurus-ai/osaurus --state all --limit 20` shows the
  newest Osaurus PRs are mostly app/plugin/UI work: #1145, #1144, #1141,
  #1140, #1139, #1138, #1137, #1136, #1135, #1134, #1132, #1131, #1130,
  #1128, #1127, #1126, #1125, #1124, and #1123 are merged; #1133 remains open
  draft for plugin host multimodal contracts. None of those change the
  vMLX runtime pin window recorded below.
- `gh pr view 1110` still reports PR #1110 open/non-draft with green checks but
  `mergeStateStatus=DIRTY`; it has no public PR comments or reviews in the
  queried metadata. Its commits remain the DSV4 runtime chain ending at
  `b0a96dd4 Wire native DSV4 tokenizer bridge`.
- `osaurus-staging` still resolves `mlx-swift 0a56f904`, `Jinja 58d21aa`,
  `swift-transformers 087a66b`, and `vmlx-swift-lm 2cc64dd` in the workspace
  `Package.resolved`. Local Osaurus edits are present but are not pinned public
  PR state.
- MTP display/helper semantics were tightened after the initial tuning-file
  patch: `MTPBundleStatus.canAutoLaunchMTP`, `speculativeDecodeEnabled`, and
  `VMLXServerRuntimeSettings.effectiveMTPLaunchMode(for:)` now require usable
  `vmlx_mtp_tuning.json` metadata, not just tensor evidence. Tensor-proven Qwen
  bundles missing tuning report off/blocked and `statusLine` says tuning is
  required.

## Current Switch Verdict

Not ready to say "single `vmlx-swift` dependency is production-clear for all
Osaurus models." Large parts are proven, but there are still explicit open
promotion blockers:

- DSV4: coherent post-fix chat exists, but long-context/vector drift, API
  route matrix, speed matrix, and low-footprint production gates remain open.
- ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ_K: still fails the production math row and cold structured VL
  cache budget. This cannot be hidden with top-k, repetition penalty, or looser
  validators.
- MiniMax large CRACK: cache-chat and strict TQ B=2 now pass after the real TQ
  cache-codec tail fix, but low-footprint active-routed proof is still open.
- Hy3 JANGTQ_K: old active-streaming evidence exists, but it needs a current
  non-Kimi all-model rerun before Osaurus promotion.
- GPT-OSS / GLM5 / Mistral4 / Pixtral: parser/unit coverage exists, but there
  are no local live decode rows in this pass.
- Omni live voice: core text/image/audio/video rows pass. A focused 2026-05-18
  cache-on repeat gate fixed the iterator bench cache-store evidence gap, but
  repeated live audio still remains a semantic quality/termination gate.
- Qwen high-resolution video: bounded media resize rows pass; raw 1080p video
  is not production-clear because the pre-fix row peaked at 164.2 GiB physical
  footprint.

## Osaurus PR Crosswalk

The main crosswalk below focuses on the active 2026-04-24 and newer runtime
pin window. Earlier April PRs still matter as lineage inputs, especially #917
structured tool calls/thinking defaults, #878 Qwen 3.6/JANGTQ, #867
template-driven reasoning detection, #863 runtime pin and lifecycle fixes, #799
Gemma4 hybrid KV, #795 VLM classification/media persistence, and tool/document
surface fixes in #827/#791/#779. Those older PRs are not counted as
switch-ready by age or merge state; they are covered only when the corresponding
row below has current `vmlx-swift` live proof.

| PR | State | Runtime payload | Current `vmlx-swift` coverage | Remaining requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #931 `fix(ci): bump vmlx-swift-lm pin to 5b84387` | merged | Early resolver pin movement. | Captured in `docs/VMLX_OSAURUS_PR_PIN_LINEAGE_2026_05_17.md`; later pins supersede this. | No standalone engine blocker; use as lineage only. |
| #932 `feat: honor per-model generation_config.json sampling defaults` | merged | Bundle `generation_config.json` defaults must flow into local generation. | Current ledger rows report bundle defaults per family: e.g. MiniMax `temp=1.000 topP=0.950 topK=40 rep=nil`, Qwen `topK=20`, ZAYA `temp=0.600 topP=1.000 topK=0`, Laguna `temp=0.700 topP=0.900`. | Keep every new live row printing resolved defaults. Do not add hidden fallback penalties or top-k clamps when a model loops. |
| #943 `feat: jang_config.json chat metadata + LFM false-thinking-block fix` | closed/unmerged | Early branch for chat metadata and false-thinking-block handling. | Superseded by #944 and later parser/no-hidden-reasoning rows. | Lineage only. Do not count #943 as shipped resolver state. |
| #944 `feat: jang_config.json chat metadata + vmlx bump` | merged | `jang_config.json` chat metadata, DSV4/Kimi/LFM routing, reasoning capability metadata. | DSV4 template/metadata rows and the non-Kimi config/template sweep are current. Kimi is deliberately excluded by user direction. | LFM is not live-cleared by this matrix; if Osaurus exposes it, add a live multi-turn/cache row. |
| #946 `feat(model-picker): Performance filter` | merged | UI filtering based on model performance/fit. | Engine docs now record speed/RSS caveats by family, especially DSV4, MiniMax, ZAYA, Qwen, Gemma4, and Omni. | Osaurus UI must consume these as explicit capability/performance metadata, not infer from name or size alone. |
| #953 `fix(preflight): detect mislabeled JANGTQ bundles + vmlx fa77575 auto-correct` | merged | Mislabeled JANGTQ detection, sidecar/family preflight, streaming/event mapping. | Current ledger keeps tensor/sidecar evidence separate from model names. ZAYA/MiniMax/Qwen CRACK rows explicitly state non-MTP unless tensor evidence exists. | Add switch-PR resolver tests that reject name-only MTP/JANGTQ claims. |
| #967 `feat: Nemotron-3 Hybrid + storage fix + multimodal API` | merged | Nemotron hybrid, multimodal content parts, storage, early resolver skew. | Fresh Omni rows cover JANGTQ/JANGTQ4/MXFP4 core text/image/audio/video, media salt, hybrid SSM, and BatchEngine rows. | Repeated cache-on audio quality remains partial; resolver skew means the Osaurus switch PR must pin one path only. |
| #990 `feat(api): OpenAI input_audio + video_url content parts` | closed/unmerged | API-surface context for audio/video content parts. | Do not treat as shipped resolver state. Its content is effectively covered later by #967/#1073 live voice/multimodal rows. | No direct switch blocker, but API route probes remain package-wide open. |
| #993 `fix(preflight): reject JANGTQ Mistral 3 / Laguna before vmlx loads` | merged | Preflight/fail-fast behavior and converged Jinja identity. | Laguna is live-proven; Mistral3/Laguna parser and JANGTQ Hadamard fixes are represented in parser/cache refresh and ledger notes. | If Osaurus re-enables Mistral3 JANGTQ, require a current live row; do not rely on preflight-only proof. |
| #998 `fix(quality): revert default KV mode .turboQuant(4,4) -> .none` | merged | Important no-fake-default precedent: global TQ caused degenerate repetition, real fix was to stop forcing it. | `vmlx-swift` now uses explicit TQ rows only. MiniMax strict TQ B=2 was fixed by preserving exact prompt tail in the TQ codec, not by forcing sampler policy. | Keep TQ off unless explicitly selected or model-compatible; never use global TQ as quality default. |
| #1037 `Ling/ZAYA hardening + BatchEngine lifecycle` | merged | Ling/Bailing, ZAYA, BatchEngine lifecycle, topology-aware cache. | Ling JANGTQ2/MXFP4 pass; ZAYA text JANGTQ4/JANGTQ_K pass; ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ4 passes. Cache proof is topology-specific: disk/SSM/CCA, not generic prefix hit. | ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ_K remains partial; Hy3 K needs current rerun. |
| #1057 `MiniMax speed fix` | merged | MiniMax speed/lifecycle, typed load config, VLM detection, tokenizer/Jinja compatibility. | Large MiniMax JANGTQ_K/JANG cache-off infer rows pass; production-shaped chat-cache row passes; strict TQ B=2 now passes after `6560879`. | Low-footprint active-routed MiniMax proof is still open. Shape-inferred 6-bit metadata repair in JANG_K should be corrected in bundle or explicitly accepted. |
| #1066 `pin DSV4 vmlx update` | merged | DSV4 tokenizer/cache/runtime pin, local tokenizer fallback. | DSV4 separator fix and template kwargs rows pass; DSV4 live cache OFF/ON chat is coherent. | DSV4 remains partial until long-context/vector/API/speed/low-footprint gates pass. |
| #1073 `Nemotron Omni live voice input path` | merged | Live voice, Parakeet/RADIO, media-cache token-aware restore, DSV4 pool/compressor fixes. | Omni JANGTQ/JANGTQ4/MXFP4 core matrices pass; current docs track Parakeet chunk concat caveat. Focused 2026-05-18 repeat-audio gate now proves block-L2 and `ssm_companion` writes for BatchEngine and manual TokenIterator paths after the bench store fix. DSV4 pool/compressor lineage is recorded. | Repeated cache-on audio semantic quality/termination and package-wide HTTP route proof remain open. |
| #1110 `Harden DSV4 reasoning gates and runtime proof` | open, dirty | Native DSV4 chat encoder/tokenizer bridge, live DSV4 proof, runtime pin check. Current Osaurus head pins `vmlx-swift-lm 2cc64dd`. | `vmlx-swift` has DSV4 prompt-boundary fix and partial live proof, but it does not yet close the full #1110 bar. | Do not treat #1110 as merged release state; switch PR must resolve dirty state and rerun DSV4 release gates. |

## Pinned Dependency Window

Current open Osaurus PR head (#1110) resolves:

| Package | Revision | Commit fact | Pin topology | `vmlx-swift` requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `osaurus-ai/mlx-swift` | `0a56f904` | `2026-05-01 deps(mlx): advance submodule to 96aa27a5 (mx::malloc tracer for Bug 2)` | Diverged from default `main`: pin carries Osaurus stream/default-stream, wired-limit, evalLock removal, custom-kernel lifetime, and malloc-tracer work; default main also has unrelated doc/API changes not in the pin. | Compare behavior through local Cmlx/MLX checkout; package identity alone is not enough. Large-allocation tracing and stream behavior remain perf/debug surfaces for long-prompt and M5 speed gates. |
| `osaurus-ai/Jinja` | `58d21aa` | `2026-05-01 fix(parser): for-loop iterable accepts binary expressions` | Identical to default `main` at refresh time. | Vendored Jinja fallback tests must keep binary iterable and `tojson(separators:)` behavior. |
| `osaurus-ai/swift-transformers` | `087a66b` | `2026-05-11 fix(tokenizer): skip unused placeholders in delimiter regex` | Diverged from default `main`: pin carries `deps: use osaurus Jinja` plus unused-placeholder delimiter skip; default `main` carries later tokenizer speed work (MetaspaceDecoder, byte-level regex/table, Bert regex, Unigram O(N)). | Tokenizers must skip `<unusedN>` placeholders and preserve wrapper-token paths for MiniMax, DSV4, Qwen, and Omni. Later speed commits are performance-watch items unless the switch PR repins or vendors them. |
| `osaurus-ai/vmlx-swift-lm` | `2cc64dd` | `2026-05-16 Wire native DSV4 chat encoder` | Pin is two commits ahead of default `main`: `c90898fb test(tooling): keep MiniMax stream open across chunks` and `2cc64dd Wire native DSV4 chat encoder`. | DSV4 native chat encoder/tokenizer bridge is part of the switch-readiness target, not yet fully released in `vmlx-swift` by a complete DSV4 gate. MiniMax streaming/open-chunk behavior must stay covered by the no-hidden-guard and chat-cache rows. |

Recent dependency scan, 2026-05-04 through 2026-05-18:

- `vmlx-swift-lm` contains the bulk of recent runtime fixes: DSV4 SWA/CSA/HSA
  correctness, DSV4 paged-incompatible disk restore, MiniMax template and
  streaming fixes, Ling/Bailing hybrid cache handling, ZAYA CCA cache and
  JANGTQ_K bit decoding, Omni live audio/RADIO/Parakeet/media-cache work, and
  DSV4 native chat encoder/tokenizer bridge. `vmlx-swift` cannot be called a
  complete replacement until the local ledger maps each of those families to
  real multi-turn/cache/media proofs or an explicit blocker.
- `swift-transformers` default-branch tokenizer speed work is not in #1110's
  pinned runtime. It should be tracked as Osaurus-switch performance risk, not
  cited as current proof.
- `mlx-swift` pin is intentionally an Osaurus fork lane, not default upstream
  `main`; stream/default-stream and malloc-tracer behavior are part of the
  low-level performance/debug contract.

## Dependency Fixes Mapped To Engine Surfaces

| Upstream fix family | Required engine surface | Current proof | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Jinja parser and compact tool JSON | DSV4/Kimi/Gemma4/ZAYA/Laguna tool templates render without broken syntax or bloated separators. | `docs/local/production-readiness/20260517T2200_jinja_pin_parity/` and parser/cache refresh rows. | Covered for non-Kimi; Kimi excluded by instruction. |
| Swift-transformers unused placeholder skip | Added-token delimiter regex must not include thousands of unused placeholders and must preserve special wrapper tokens. | Vendored tokenizer static check plus MiniMax/DSV4/Qwen/Omni live template rows. | Covered for pinned behavior; later speed commits not yet part of Osaurus pin. |
| Generation defaults | Bundle defaults are source of truth before explicit request override. | Ledger rows print temp/topP/topK/minP/rep per family. | Covered for tested rows; require same telemetry for new rows. |
| Hybrid SSM / CCA / SWA cache | Cache proof must be topology-specific, not generic prefix-hit. | Qwen/Ling/ZAYA/Gemma4 rows record disk L2, SSM companion, CCA, SWA incompatibility, and media salt where applicable. Fresh Gemma E2B refresh records disk hits/stores plus VL media-salt restore; fresh Ling no-guard refresh confirms Bailing template/decode stress without fake sampler fixes. | Covered for listed PASS rows; DSV4 long-context and ZAYA1-VL K remain open. |
| TurboQuant KV | Explicit TQ mode must preserve coherency and prove actual compression. | `20260518T_minimax_m27_jangtqk_tq_tail_fix_exact/` proves actual TQ transitions and exact outputs after tail preservation. | Fixed for MiniMax strict row; keep family-by-family gates. |
| VL/media salt | Image/video/audio state must be isolated across turns and cache hits. | Qwen, ZAYA1-VL, Gemma4, and Omni rows prove same/different media behavior where implemented. | Raw Qwen high-res video and repeated Omni cache-on audio remain open. |
| Reasoning on/off | No fake close; reasoning off must affect template/runtime where supported, and visible output must remain coherent. | Gemma4 reasoning matrix, MiniMax rows, DSV4 reasoning kwargs, Ling/Bailing aliases. Fresh Gemma E2B no-guard red/green pair proves the harness now accepts coherent stellar equivalents instead of forcing decode behavior; fresh Ling row proves the Russian stress prompt with `temp=0.7` stops normally. | Covered for tested families; package-wide model matrix still open for absent local bundles. |
| MTP autodetect | Only real tensor evidence plus usable tuning may enable MTP; model names and stale metadata are insufficient. Qwen auto-depth must come from bundle-local `vmlx_mtp_tuning.json`, not profile/name rules. | Non-Kimi MTP census and Qwen MTP settings docs; CRACK rows explicitly stay MTP off. Focused tests cover tuned D2, validated D3, missing tuning, blocked tuning rows, and status/helper display behavior. | Correct fail-closed policy covered; full MTP speed target remains separate/open. |

## Production-Quality Checklist Still Required

Before the Osaurus switch PR can honestly say `vmlx-swift` replaces the split
libraries, every exposed model family needs:

1. Config/template row with resolved `generation_config.json` defaults.
2. Multi-turn live row with visible coherent output, normal stop, no loops, no
   gibberish, no hidden reasoning-only fake pass.
3. Reasoning on/off/effort row where the family supports reasoning.
4. Tool parser row where the family supports tools.
5. Cache-on/cache-off row with topology-specific stats:
   prefix/paged/L2 disk/TurboQuant/SSM/CCA/SWA/media salt as applicable.
6. Continuous batching row for single-slot and B=2 behavior.
7. VL/video/audio row with real media payloads where the family supports media.
8. Speed and RAM row, including tok/s and physical-footprint caveat.
9. Failure rows left visible with artifact paths; no sampler guard, fake EOS,
   fake `</think>`, name-based MTP, or forced repetition penalty.

The active ledger files for those rows remain:
