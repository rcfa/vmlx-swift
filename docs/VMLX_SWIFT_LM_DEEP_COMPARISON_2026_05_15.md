# vmlx-swift vs vmlx-swift-lm Deep Comparison - 2026-05-15

This compares the current `vmlx-swift` production-engine branch against the
live sibling checkout at `../vmlx-swift-lm`.

## Snapshot

- Current repo: `vmlx-swift`, branch `vmlx-0.31.3`, HEAD `df44b86` before this
  working-tree patch set.
- Reference repo: `../vmlx-swift-lm`, branch `main`, HEAD `81c8ef7`, behind
  `origin/main` by 5 commits and dirty.
- Treat `../vmlx-swift-lm` as reference evidence, not clean upstream. It has
  useful fixes, but it also carries local experimental deltas and stale policy
  that must not be copied blindly.

## Package Shape

`vmlx-swift` is already the consolidated engine shape: vendored MLX, Jinja,
Transformers/tokenizers, MLXPress, distributed targets, RunBench, and focused
runtime tests live in one package.

`../vmlx-swift-lm` is much slimmer and still depends on external packages such
as `mlx-swift`, `Jinja`, and `swift-transformers`. A no-index package stat shows
`Package.swift` differs by `260 insertions / 495 deletions` when compared from
this repo to the sibling. That shape should not be imported wholesale; it would
undo the consolidated-engine goal.

Current-only runtime files found in the core library trees:

- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Cache/JangPressMachCache.swift`
- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Cache/MLXPressMmapColdSweep.swift`
- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/TurboQuant/NumPyPCG64.swift`

These are part of the current engine surface, not things to remove just because
the slimmer sibling does not carry them.

## Ported Now

### ZAYA / ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ_K Metadata

The sibling had useful handling for nested `mxtq_bits.routed_expert` metadata.
This is a real correctness issue because JANGTQ_K can encode separate
`gate_proj`/`up_proj`/`down_proj` widths. If the runtime collapses that metadata
wrongly, it can dispatch the fused gate+up kernel with the wrong bit width or
lose the down-projection width.

Ported into `vmlx-swift`:

- `Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/Zaya.swift`
  - Directly decodes flat, per-role, and nested JANGTQ_K `mxtq_bits`.
  - Preserves `mxtq_gate_up_bits` and `mxtq_down_bits`.
  - Rejects mismatched `gate_proj` and `up_proj` instead of silently choosing
    one.
- `Libraries/MLXLLM/LLMModelFactory.swift`
  - ZAYA probe now uses `JSONDecoder.json5()`.
  - ZAYA probe reads nested projection bits and falls back to
    `config.textConfig.weightFormat` when the probe lacks `weight_format`.
  - `jang_config.json` merge now rejects mismatched gate/up widths instead of
    warning and continuing.
- `Libraries/MLXVLM/VLMModelFactory.swift`
  - VLM `jang_config.json` merge now handles nested `mxtq_bits`.
  - Top-level `mxtq_seed` is copied when not present in `quantization`.
  - Gate/up mismatch throws a configuration error.
- `Libraries/MLXVLM/Models/Zaya1VL.swift`
  - `mxtq_seed` is decoded, encoded, bridged into `ZayaTextConfiguration`, and
    used by the native ZAYA1-VL JANGTQ MoE context.

Active test coverage added:

- `Tests/MLXLMCommonFocusedTests/ZayaConfigDecodeFocusedTests.swift`
- `Tests/MLXLMCommonFocusedTests/VLShapeGuardFocusedTests.swift`

Legacy test coverage also updated in `Tests/MLXLMTests/ZayaConfigDecodeTests.swift`,
but that older test folder is not wired into the current package manifest. The
active coverage is the focused target.

Verification:

```sh
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer \
swift test --filter 'ZayaConfigDecodeFocusedTests|VLShapeGuardFocusedTests|DeepseekV4ReasoningPolicyTests' --jobs 2
```

Result: 16 tests in 3 suites passed.

## Already Aligned

These files have no current no-index source diff against the sibling snapshot:

- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/BatchEngine/BatchEngine.swift`
- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/BatchEngine/BatchScheduler.swift`
- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Cache/CacheHelpers.swift`
- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Cache/MediaSalt.swift`
- `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/TurboQuantSwitchLinear.swift`

That does not prove production behavior, but it means there is no obvious source
delta to port for those files in this comparison pass.

## File Delta Ledger

This is the current no-index source comparison status for the core files that
still differ from `../vmlx-swift-lm`.

| File or area | Delta | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Libraries/MLXLLM/LLMModelFactory.swift` | Small residual diff after ZAYA port. Remaining difference is mostly comment/policy around Kimi/DSV3 MLA. | Keep current until real Kimi/DSV3 decode proof says the fp32 L==1 helper is unnecessary. |
| `Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/DeepseekV3.swift` | Current uses `mlaScaledDotProductAttention`; sibling uses `attentionWithCacheUpdate`. Current also has stricter grouped-router masking. | Do not port blindly. This affects Kimi/DSV3 decode numerics and cache update semantics. Needs side-by-side model smoke. |
| `Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/DeepseekV3JANGTQ.swift` | Current carries MLXPress streaming/profiling, per-projection gate/down bits, chunked MoE, and cold-sweep hooks; sibling is much simpler. | Keep current for now. Validate by MiniMax/Kimi/Qwen JANGTQ active expert rows, not source preference. |
| `Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/DeepseekV4Compressor.swift` and `DeepseekV4MathHelpers.swift` | Sibling is much smaller. Current carries more DSV4 helper code. | Needs DSV4 long-context/vector drift review before any deletion or port. |
| `Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/Hy3.swift` | Current has `MLXPressMmapColdSweep.afterLayer`; sibling removes it. | Keep current. This is part of low-footprint cleanup; only remove if a live Hy3 row proves it hurts correctness or speed. |
| `Libraries/MLXLLM/Models/MiniMaxJANGTQ.swift` | Current carries more JANGTQ_K/per-role handling than sibling. | Keep current pending MiniMax active routed expert validation. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/ModelFactory.swift` | Current makes permanent prestack explicit opt-in and keeps tensor-buffer mmap diagnostic gated; sibling runs prestacker more broadly and enables tensor mmap when JangPress mmap is on. | Keep current. Sibling behavior risks hidden full-footprint or stale prestack dependence; needs low-RAM proof before changing. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Load.swift` | Current treats `weight_format=mxtq` / JANGTQ profile as native even without sidecar because `JANGTQRuntimeCache` can generate deterministic signs/codebooks. Sibling requires sidecar and fail-fast errors. | Open. This is policy-sensitive: deterministic generation is real code, not a sampling guard, but missing-sidecar bundles still need explicit runtime proof. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/JANGTQKernels.swift` | Large current-only implementation around PCG64/codebook and newer kernels. | Keep current. Test by kernel-focused unit tests plus live JANGTQ decode rows. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/JANGTQStreamingExperts.swift` | Very large current-only active-streaming implementation. | Keep current while auditing missing tensor diagnostics, active bank selection, offset-addressed kernels, and low-footprint behavior. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/JangLoader.swift` | Current has more loader/template-sidecar behavior. | Review with VL template and JANG bundle config matrix. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/Evaluate.swift` | Current is larger and carries current profiling/cache/sampling/reasoning work. | Review route by route; do not port sibling simplification until API behavior passes. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/ChatTemplates/ChatTemplateFallbacks.swift` | Current is much larger. | Keep current; verify with DSV4, MiniMax, ZAYA-VL, tool-calling, and reasoning matrix. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/DeepseekV4ChatEncoder.swift` | Sibling comments assume public max is normalized to high. Current preserves raw pass-through. | Keep current per no-hidden-downgrade policy. |
| `Libraries/MLXLMCommon/DeepseekV4ReasoningPolicy.swift` | Sibling downgrades low/medium/max into high by default. | Rejected. Current focused tests preserve pass-through. |
| `Libraries/MLXVLM/Models/NemotronHOmni/NemotronHOmni.swift` | Only arrow/comment punctuation differs. | No runtime action. |
| `Libraries/MLXVLM/Models/Zaya1VL.swift` | Useful seed/nested-bit pieces were ported while preserving this repo's stronger dynamic decoder. | Done for metadata. Still needs live VL multi-turn proof. |

## Explicitly Rejected From vmlx-swift-lm

### DSV4 Reasoning Downgrade Policy

The sibling carries a `DeepseekV4ReasoningPolicy` shape that can alias public
`reasoning_effort=max`/`low`/`medium` into another value unless gated by an
environment variable. That is a hidden behavioral guard and conflicts with the
current production rule: if a caller asks for `max`, it must reach the encoder as
`max`.

Current `vmlx-swift` keeps the pass-through policy. The focused tests prove:

- public `max` passes through without downgrade;
- `low`, `medium`, and `high` remain distinct;
- direct/no-think rails remove reasoning effort intentionally;
- non-DSV4 contexts are unchanged.

### Sibling Package Slimming

The sibling package graph is not a target state for this repo. `vmlx-swift` must
replace and consolidate MLX/Jinja/Transformers-style dependencies for Osaurus,
not move back to external repo stitching.

### Historical Speed Claims

Old JangPress and MiniMax speed rows remain useful as targets, not proof. A row
is not production-ready unless it has current low physical footprint, tok/s,
coherent visible output, no loop/length-cap fake pass, multi-turn behavior, and
cache-topology proof.

## High-Risk Deltas Still Requiring Deep Review

These are not ignored. They are the next comparison lanes because they touch
runtime behavior and cannot be safely copied by stat/diff alone.

| Area | Current comparison state | Required proof before accepting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JANGTQStreamingExperts.swift` | Huge source delta; this repo has the larger implementation. | Sidecar missing-array behavior, active-streaming low-RAM path, resident vs ephemeral overlays, no full-footprint hidden load, token/s and multi-turn coherence. |
| `Evaluate.swift` | Large delta; this repo carries current MLXPress profiling, KV-policy salting, and DSV4 reasoning pass-through work. | HTTP/BatchEngine/TokenIterator parity, sampling defaults, reasoning on/off, tool stream splitting, no hidden clamps. |
| `DeepseekV4ChatEncoder.swift` and `DSV4Minimal.jinja` | Small but policy-sensitive deltas. | `enable_thinking`, `reasoning_effort=max`, CSA/HSA/SWA long context, prefix/paged/disk cache proof, vector drift check. |
| `BatchEngine.swift` / `BatchScheduler.swift` | No current no-index source diff against the sibling snapshot. | Still requires live B>1 continuous batching, cancel, mid-stream failure, cache isolation by policy salt, and hybrid cache behavior. |
| `MediaSalt.swift` and VL path | `MediaSalt.swift` is source-aligned; VLM model/factory files still differ. | Image+text -> text-only -> new image multi-turn, nil media salt on text-only turn, prefix resume correctness, grounded output. |
| `Hy3.swift` | Sibling dirty delta exists. | Real Hy3 local smoke with reasoning on/off, correct chat template, no repeated empty think blocks, cache stack behavior. |
| `JangPress*` cache files | Sibling dirty deltas exist; this repo also has newer Mach/cache cold-sweep files. | Prove active routed experts, low physical footprint, useful decode speed, no per-token SSD bottleneck, coherent multi-turn output. |

## Production Readiness Implication

This comparison pass does not make the whole engine production-ready. It closes
one concrete correctness gap: ZAYA/ZAYA1-VL nested JANGTQ_K metadata and seed
plumbing now match the useful sibling behavior while preserving this repo's
stricter no-fake-guard policy.

The remaining production gate is behavioral, not just source parity:

- each model family needs live multi-turn generation;
- each attention/cache topology needs prefix/paged/L2/SSM/VL proof where
  applicable;
- DSV4 needs long-context CSA/HSA/SWA, prefix/paged/disk, pool/finalizer, and
  vector drift proof;
- MiniMax/JANGTQ needs low-footprint active expert behavior plus coherent
  multi-turn speed rows;
- VL/video/audio paths need real media payloads and grounded multi-turn cache
  validation;
- API and Osaurus wiring must be tested through the live routes, not just by
  reading source.

## Next Comparison Order

1. `JANGTQStreamingExperts.swift` and JangPress cache files: identify whether
   sibling deltas improve real active-routed low-RAM behavior or are stale.
2. `Evaluate.swift`, `BatchEngine.swift`, `BatchScheduler.swift`: isolate
   behavior-affecting scheduler/cache/sampling changes.
3. `DeepseekV4ChatEncoder.swift`, `DSV4Minimal.jinja`, DSV4 tests: prove no
   hidden reasoning downgrade and no long-context cache regression.
4. `MediaSalt.swift`, `Zaya1VL.swift`, VLM factory/tests: complete the VL
   multi-turn media-cache proof.
5. Osaurus staging wiring: compare pins and route expectations after the engine
   source lanes are resolved.
