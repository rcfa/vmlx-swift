# Qwen3.6 Native MTP Production Reverify - 2026-05-17

This note records the fresh production-style Qwen3.6 native-MTP rerun after the
short-budget reasoning failures in the first six-variant matrix. It covers the
MXFP variants only; the user explicitly narrowed the current MTP follow-up away
from JANG_4M/JANG_2K for this pass.

Artifact root:

```text
docs/local/qwen36-mtp-current/
```

`docs/local/` is gitignored; paths below are local evidence references.

## Gate Contract

All four rows used the same gate shape:

- `BENCH_PROD=1`
- `BENCH_PROD_NATIVE_MTP_DEPTH=3`
- `VMLINUX_NATIVE_MTP_HYBRID_VERIFY=chunk_commit`
- `BENCH_PROD_COORD=1`
- `BENCH_PROD_CACHE_HYBRID=1`
- `BENCH_MAX_TOKENS=384`

The sampling row came from each bundle's `generation_config.json`:
`temp=1.000 topP=0.950 topK=20 minP=0.000 rep=nil`. No forced repetition
penalty, forced greedy decode, forced reasoning close, or output-moving guard
was used.

`chunk_commit` remains explicit. These rows prove the current opt-in path; they
do not justify auto-launching native MTP for every Qwen3.6 bundle or enabling it
inside generic batched scheduling.

The gate scenarios were:

- S1 reasoning ON math;
- S2 same prompt with cache reuse candidate;
- S3 reasoning OFF factual;
- S4 reasoning ON -> OFF -> ON alternation inside one engine;
- S5 UTF-8 verbatim output.

Every row produced visible answers, no loop/leak, normal stop, L2 disk writes,
and an SSM companion hit. The previous "answer only appeared in reasoning" rows
were caused by the short production-gate budget for these MXFP artifacts. With
384 tokens, the model naturally closes reasoning and emits visible content.

## Still Open

- This does not change the default: AR remains global default and native MTP
  remains tensor-gated plus explicit opt-in.
- Raw batched native-MTP scheduling is still not implemented; use the exclusive
  `BatchEngine.generate` / `Evaluate.generate` path.
- 27B MXFP8 D3 is correct but not the best speed policy; earlier speed sweeps
  still recommend D2 for the count-prompt speed row.
- The strict VL+MTP blocker for `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-MXFP4-MTP` is not resolved by
  this text-production rerun. It still needs root-cause work before full
  text+VL production readiness.
