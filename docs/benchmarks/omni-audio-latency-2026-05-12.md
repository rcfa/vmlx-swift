# Nemotron Omni Audio Latency Bench - 2026-05-12

Host: local M5 Max MacBook.

Model: `Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ-CRACK`

Bench executable: `swift run OmniAudioLatencyBench`

2026-05-17 consolidation update: this executable is now registered in the
top-level `vmlx-swift` package. The measurements below are the original
standalone Swift LM evidence; current release-built `vmlx-swift` artifacts are
listed in `docs/VMLX_ACTIVE_MODEL_PRODUCTION_SCOPE_2026_05_17.md`.

2026-05-17 current-source correction: the bench now constructs
`GenerateParameters` from `context.configuration.generationDefaults` and prints
the resolved sampling row. The current JANGTQ artifact shows
`temperature=0.600`, `top_p=0.950`, `top_k=0`, `min_p=0.000`, and
`repetition_penalty=1.000`; no greedy temperature override is applied unless a
caller adds one explicitly outside this bench.

2026-05-17 fresh `vmlx-swift` reverify:
`docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260517T_omni_reverify/omni_audio_latency_jangtq4_both_paths.log`
loads `Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK` as `NemotronHOmni`, uses the same
bundle sampling defaults, and passes both streaming surfaces:

- Parakeet pre-encode: 63 audio tokens, hidden size 2,688, 43.4 ms.
- BatchEngine raw PCM turns: first delta 240.2 ms / 219.9 ms, coherent audio
  descriptions, 35.1 / 37.1 effective tok/s.
- BatchEngine pre-encoded turns: first delta 179.4 ms / 196.9 ms, coherent
  audio descriptions, 42.7 / 41.3 effective tok/s.
- TokenIterator raw PCM turns: first delta 192.8 ms / 194.8 ms, coherent audio
  descriptions, 40.3 / 40.3 effective tok/s.
- TokenIterator pre-encoded turns: first delta 159.5 ms / 162.0 ms, coherent
  audio descriptions, 45.7 / 45.2 effective tok/s.
- Prompt topology remains media-aware: 96 prompt tokens, 63 audio placeholders,
  media token ids `[18, 27]`, 11 media tokens after the 64-token cache boundary.

2026-05-17 current checkout spot-check:
`docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260517T130344Z_omni_current_audio_grounding_probe/omni_audio_grounding_probe.log`
was run from the release-built `OmniAudioLatencyBench` with
`BENCH_MAX_TOKENS=32`, `BENCH_AUDIO_REPEATS=2`,
`BENCH_OMNI_AUDIO_PATH=both`, and bundle sampling defaults. It reloaded the
JANGTQ4 Omni bundle as `NemotronHOmni`, pre-encoded Parakeet into 63 audio
tokens in 45.9 ms, and produced grounded audio descriptions on BatchEngine and
TokenIterator for both raw PCM and pre-encoded audio. The same run recorded
media-aware prompt topology with 102 prompt tokens, 63 audio placeholders,
media ids `[18, 27]`, and 11 media placeholders after the 64-token cache
boundary. First-delta timings were 223-234 ms for BatchEngine raw PCM, 188-210
ms for BatchEngine pre-encoded Parakeet, 201-205 ms for TokenIterator raw PCM,
and 171-172 ms for TokenIterator pre-encoded Parakeet.

2026-05-17 10:43 PDT post-wrapper-fix spot-check:
`docs/local/live-model-matrix/20260517T174343Z_omni_parakeet_fresh_verify/omni_audio_latency_jangtq4_both_paths_cache_off_32_fresh.jsonl`
reloads `Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ4-CRACK`, uses bundle sampling defaults, and
keeps audio wrapper tokens source-compatible (`<so_start>`, `<so_end>`,
repeated `<so_embedding>` slots). Parakeet pre-encode produced 63 audio tokens
at hidden size 2,688 in 45.8 ms. The cache-off first-delta/tok-s rows were:
BatchEngine raw PCM 223.6 ms / 64.5 tok/s, BatchEngine pre-encoded 169.5 ms /
72.4 tok/s, TokenIterator raw PCM 183.9 ms / 68.9 tok/s, and TokenIterator
pre-encoded 151.6 ms / 74.8 tok/s. All four visible outputs were grounded in
the same beep/chime fixture and did not leak literal sound-marker text.

## Command

```sh
BENCH_OMNI_AUDIO_PATH=batch \
BENCH_OMNI_AUDIO_PREENCODE=1 \
BENCH_OMNI_AUDIO_DISK_CACHE=1 \
BENCH_AUDIO_REPEATS=2 \
BENCH_AUDIO_FILE=Tests/MLXLMTests/Resources/audio_only.mov \
BENCH_MAX_TOKENS=8 \
BENCH_MODEL=<absolute path to Nemotron-Omni-Nano-JANGTQ-CRACK> \
/usr/bin/time -l .build/debug/OmniAudioLatencyBench
```

## Result

Audio fixture: `Tests/MLXLMTests/Resources/audio_only.mov`, 80,620 samples,
5,038.8 ms at 16 kHz.

Load: 2,289.1 ms, RSS 5,267.2 MiB.

Pre-encode: 1,335.8 ms for 63 audio tokens at hidden size 2,688.

Prompt topology: 94 prompt tokens, 63 media placeholder tokens, media positions
12...74, `cache_block_size=64`, and 11 media placeholder tokens in the suffix
after the 64-token cache boundary. `prompt_minus_one_after_media=true`, but
the default live-call path does not run an extra prompt-minus-one media
re-prefill because that pushed first-turn latency up in testing and disk
restore was slower than a short pre-encoded forward.

## Read

This bench measures first semantic text delta, not output TTS first audio
byte. Raw PCM is still over the awkward-pause threshold on this fixture
because Parakeet audio encoding and multimodal prefill happen after endpoint.
Passing pre-encoded Parakeet embeddings into `UserInput.Audio.preEncoded`
brings first semantic delta to about 200 ms on the Osaurus BatchEngine path.

Turn 2 raw PCM is still roughly 1.5 s. Do not count raw identical-audio repeat
as a solved conversational prefix-cache path; the 64-token cache block splits
the 63-token audio placeholder run, and exact full hybrid hits are intentionally
skipped because re-feeding the last token would double-count recurrent state.
The live-call path should stream/accumulate Parakeet embeddings while the
caller is speaking and submit pre-encoded audio at endpoint.
