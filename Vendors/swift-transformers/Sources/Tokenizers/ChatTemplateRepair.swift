/// Repairs a chat template that would strand generation outside of any turn.
///
/// ## The failure
///
/// The gemma-4 templates close the assistant turn when a history message carries BOTH
/// content AND tool calls, and then — because the last thing emitted was a tool response —
/// `add_generation_prompt` skips the `<|turn>model` role header. Generation therefore
/// begins *after a closed turn, with no role*. The model has nothing telling it who is
/// speaking, so it improvises the scaffolding it has seen around assistant turns: it emits
/// `thought` / `<channel|>` openers. In a long agent context it locks onto that and repeats
/// the header line forever:
///
///     thought
///     <channel|>£thought
///     <channel|>o'thought
///     <channel|>o'thought          ← until the token budget runs out
///
/// It only fires after real tool use — a turn with tool calls but no content leaves the turn
/// open, so plain chat repros stay clean, which is exactly why this survived so long.
///
/// ## Why repair it here
///
/// Patching the bundle on disk does not hold: the loader re-fetches `tokenizer_config.json`
/// and `chat_template.jinja` from the Hub, silently restoring the broken template. Repairing
/// the template string in memory, at the one point where every path selects it, fixes every
/// already-downloaded bundle without a re-download and cannot be undone by a refetch.
///
/// This is not a behavioural workaround. It biases no logits, injects no thinking tags, and
/// coerces no output — it hands the model a well-formed turn instead of a malformed one. The
/// bundles should still be corrected at the source; this keeps users working until they are.
