// It could. Reported live on an M5 Max / 128 GB running Llama-3.3-70B-8bit at a
// 64K context: the reporter's own footprint time series showed prefill tracking
// expectation (75 -> 102 GiB), then +23 GiB immediately after generation, inside
// the cache-store window — ~23 GiB being exactly the size of the 62K-token KV
// cache. Free memory collapsed, page reclaim stalled, and the kernel panicked.
// macOS will not jetsam a plain user process out of the way, so nothing
// intervenes: the cap has to live here.
//
// These tests pin the arithmetic that decides whether the store fits, and pin it
// to the user's memory-safety level rather than to a number we picked.
