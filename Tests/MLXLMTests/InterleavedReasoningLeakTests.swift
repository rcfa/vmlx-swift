// Interleaved reasoning + thinking-tag leak audit. Locks the contract
// that ReasoningParser preserves the boundary between visible content
// and `<think>...</think>` reasoning across:
//
//   - Multi-turn streams (turn 1 has reasoning, turn 2 doesn't, turn 3
//     has reasoning again — no marker leak between turns)
//   - Token-boundary splits across feed() calls (`<thi` then `nk>`)
//   - Mid-reasoning stream truncation (max_tokens cap inside `<think>`
//     — leftover buffer must NOT leak markers into next turn's content)
//   - Empty think blocks (`<think></think>` — zero reasoning bytes,
//     no spurious `.reasoning("")` events)
//   - Stray closer in content mode — must be passed through as content
//
// Pure unit tests over the parser API. Covers the leak surfaces every
// shipping model family routes through (Nemotron-3, Qwen 3.5/3.6,
// MiniMax, Kimi, GLM, Laguna — all `think_xml` stamp).
