// Stage 1A scaffolding for bucketed compile-in-batch.
//
// Full design:  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-18-batch-engine-blockers-design.md`
// (specifically §4.4 cache ownership model, §6 Stage 1 bucketed compile path).
//
// This file currently ships the *types and pure-logic helpers* — bucket
// selection, cache-family classification, key equality — without any
// wiring into `BatchEngine`. Stage 1B will:
//   - Add the `BucketHandle` class that actually owns per-layer
//     `[B, H, maxLen, D]` CompilableKVCache buffers + a compiled forward
//     closure.
//   - Wire admission + prefill handoff + stepBatchDecode partitioning into
//     BatchEngine.
//   - Add integration tests that actually compile() a trace and assert
//     decode determinism vs the uncompiled path.
//
// Keeping the 1A/1B split means Stage 1A's types and their logic can be
// unit-tested in isolation. The narrow scope also means this file is safe
// to merge ahead of 1B — nothing here runs unless 1B wires it in, and
// `enableCompiledBatchDecode` defaults to `false` anyway.
