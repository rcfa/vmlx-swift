// Architecture-agnostic resolution of the RMSNorm "(1 + weight)" shift convention.
//
// Several architectures (qwen3.5, qwen3-next, gemma-family, …) store RMSNorm weights as the
// deviation from 1 and apply `(1 + weight)` at load. Whether a given bundle needs that shift is
// authoritative information that should be *declared* — by the bundle (safetensors `metadata` or
// `config.json` `norm_convention`) or by the architecture itself — never guessed from the weights.
//
// This type centralizes that resolution so every model shares one correct implementation instead of
// hand-rolling its own. The hand-rolled version this replaces (in qwen3.5) returned on the FIRST
// probe norm in (per-process randomized) Swift `Dictionary` iteration order, which silently
// degenerated ~7.5% of loads when a few raw norms legitimately had mean > 0.5. New `(1 + weight)`
// architectures should adopt `shouldApplyPlusOneShift(...)` rather than re-implementing this.
